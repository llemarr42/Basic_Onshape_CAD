## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second assignment was to make a mount that was 120 mm x 120 mm and had 5 holes that lined up with the bases holes including the big hole.

### Reflection

For this assignment I made a copy of the base by right clicking the part studio then hitting duplicate, after i did that i changed the measurments including the linear equation.

## Fork

### Description

I made the Fork by extruding two prongs and a third extrusion two make a hollow cylinder to secure it to the base and mount.

### Reflection

I had to learn how to use fillets(shift + f) in onshape, as well as, the chamfer tool.

## Tire

### Description

I made the Tire by using a revolve extrusions.

### Reflection

There wasn't much that I had trouble with, the hardest thing to do for me was to get the sketch to be defined, you have to define the angles and make the two horizantal lines are parallel.

## Wheel

### Description

I made the wheel with a revolve and circular pattern then I filleted it.

### Reflection

This was my first time using the circular pattern, so I was confused when it didn't do anything. I found out that the problem was that it needed to be changed into a feature pattern rather than the part pattern.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

I made an axle, collar, and two bearings using simple sketches and extrusions.

### Reflection

When making this I didn't use a syrmetrical extrusion, which came back to bite me when I had to mirror the (remove)extrusion. all theat has to be done to avoid this is to click blind then change it to syrmetric

## Assembly

### Discription

I put all of the parts together in a assembly using fastened and revolution mates, then I added hardware(nuts, bolts, and pins)

### Reflection

I learned how to use the hardware. go to insert then standard content, after that choose what you want and make sure you use the right measurments. When inserting it is easier in my oppinion to click on the place you want to insert the part to before clicking insert so bolt or nut just appears there.
